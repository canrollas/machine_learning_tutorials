### What is machine learning?

- Machine learning is extracting data from real life to train computer or hardware to make predictive,enthusiastic
  actions.
- It is discipline of Computer science and statistics.
- Nowadays, every machine has AI and ML algorithm. Making better algorithms and choices bases on Machine learning.

    - For example automatic drives in cars and planes is ML algorithms.
- Moreover, It has enormous area of application => Moleculer Science , Electronic Engineering , Physics , Finance etc...

### Why machine learning ?

- If you are using spam filter in your computer/ mail . You can see that filter is works perfect without command. If
  there was no AI/ML in CS it will be like => SPAM Tick every time by your hand.
