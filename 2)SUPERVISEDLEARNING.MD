# WHAT IS SUPERVISED LEARNING?

- In other chapters we mentioned that supervised learning.
- Supervised learning is certain outcome when we want to predict from certain datasets.
- Our goal is to make accurate predictions.

### Types of  SUPERVISED LEARNING

- There are two major types of machine learning.
- Number 1 is Classification.
- Number 2 is Regression.

### What is Classification and Regression?

- Goal of classification is predicting a class label of the outcome.
- For example We Made a prediction about type of flower based on iris data in previous chapter.
- Another good example of this label prediction is spam filter.
- For the regression algorithms , the goal is predicting a continuous number or a floating point number in programming terms.
- Example of regression can be predicting age,year of education,salary  etc.

### Generalization, Overfitting and Underfitting

- In supervised learning we want to make precise predictions.
- We want to build a model that is able to generalize as accurately as possible.
- All in all, Generalization means building accurate model for our algorithm.
- Overfitting means that over training the machine/hardware/computer that is not efficient generally; because it requires lots of time complexity or hardware complexity most of the time.
- Imagine that how complex is ML algorithms.
- Underfitting means that less training the machine. Algorithm will make wrong predictions under these circumstances.
- With other sentences overfitting is basically building the model that has complex amount of information.
- Choosing too simple model is underfitting.
- There is sweet spot between that will yield the best generalization performance.

### Relations of DATA SIZE - MODEL COMPLEXITY

- Basically if the data size is going up; Complexity of model will be up.
- It has many applications data size and model complexity.
