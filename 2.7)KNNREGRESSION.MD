# 2.7) KNN REGRESSION AND CLASSIFICATION

### The key differences are:

- KNN regression tries to predict the value of the output variable by using a local average.
- KNN classification attempts to predict the class to which the output variable belong by computing the local
  probability.
- The KNN Regression logic is very similar to what was explained above in the picture. The only difference is that it is
  working with numbers. So what the KNeighborsRegressor() algorithm from sklearn library will do is to calculate the
  regression for the dataset and then take the n_neighbors parameter with the number chosen, check the results of those
  neighbors and average the results, giving you an estimated result.
